## Method 1 (Equal Tee)
## Method 2 (Unequal Concentric)
## Method 3: By Projection (Concentric)

This fitting is Concentric, meaning the branch and header are on the center line.

Begin by drawing with actual dimensions the header pipe from an end view and the branch connection on same center line directly above.

Now draw the half circle on end of branch and extend out the height of branch and draw the stretch-out.

Greens lines are to show the extension of branch to develop the stretch-out.

Now divide up the stretch-out into 16 equal spaces and divide the half circle up as well. *Note: Since this is a concentric branch and everything is off of center, we can get away with only dividing half the half circle, it is a mirror of the other side.*

Now transfer lines from end view to the stretch-out and number match them and place out tick marks.

Now draw a curved line between tick marks and remove transfer line.

Remove the non-essential lines and the template is ready to use.

## Method 4: By Projection (Eccentric)

The procedure for the Eccentric and Concentric are near identical.  The only real difference comes into the fact that the Eccentric branch is off-center.  When dividing up the half circle for the concentric projection, we could get away with only laying out half because it was a mirror image.  The Eccentric is off-center and to show the details of where the lines intersect, we will divide up the entire circle.

Start by drawing the end view of Header and Branch.  You will notice that the Branch is off of the center line of the header.  This offset will be determined by layout needed to make up this fitting and may vary depending on what the situation dictates.

Now draw the semicircle on the end of the branch and extend out the height of branch and draw the stretch-out.

Greens lines are to show the extension of branch to develop the stretch-out.

![Fig. 2](/Metal_Patterns/img/Tee/2-5.png)

Now we can divide up the stretch-out into 16 equal spaces and divide the half circle up as well. *Note: Since this is an eccentric branch and is not on-center, We have to divide up the entire semicircle.*

Now we can transfer lines from end view to the stretch-out and number match them and place out tick marks.

![Fig. 4](/Metal_Patterns/img/Tee/4-5.png)

Now we can draw our curved line between tick marks and remove transfer lines.

Remove the non-essential lines and the template is ready to use.
