# Stovepipe 90° Elbow
 
With some basic geometry, we know that a 90° bend can be divided into two 45° "miter" angles. Any other angle can be halved as well.

![Fig. 1.1](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.01.png)

Thus, to start with, draw a side view to-scale of a miter cut with that angle on the insulation.

![Fig. 1.2](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.02.png)

Now draw a semicircle off the bottom end and divide it into 8 equal parts. Number each place where a line intersects the arc of half circle.

![Fig. 1.3](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.03.png)

Now, at each point on the arc draw a straight line from arc to where it intercepts the 45° line. Those are your element lines.

Now to construct the stretch-out of the template, extend the bottom and top lines to the right from the first view drawn. The overall length of the stretch-out will be the circumference of your pipe. The green lines indicate how to transfer the overall height of object to the stretch-out.

![Fig. 1.5](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.05.png)

Now divide the stretch-out into 16 equal parts.

![Fig. 1.6](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.06.png)

Now you have both the stretch-out and the side view in alignment and can start to transfer elements over to the stretch-out.

 ![Fig. 1.7](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.07.png)

The numbers will correlate to each other from one drawing to the other. Place a straight horizontal line from mitered line over to the stretch-out and where the numbers match-up, make a tick mark.

![Fig. 1.8](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.08.png)

![Fig. 1.9](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.09.png)

Now connect a curved line between the tick marks.

![Fig. 1.10](/Metal_Patterns/img/90_Stovepipe/fig1.10.png)

Remove the top section of lines above the curve on the stretch-out. Cut your template out and it is ready to use.
