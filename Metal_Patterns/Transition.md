# Transition
Or beveled cap, being a frustrum of a cone

### 45° Cone

To make a cone, first set your dividers to the radius of the desired base. Use this to mark two points on a right angle. Then set the dividers to the distance between these points. This is the slant height of the desired cone.

#### Logic

At a 45° angle, the height of a cone is equal to the radius; thus forming a right triangle with the slant as the hypotenuse.
