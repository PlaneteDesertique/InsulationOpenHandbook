# Open Handbook for Industrial Insulation

A (work-in-progress) handbook and reference guide for industrial insulation, libre et gratuit

## Purpose

The intention of this work is to make freely available the practical and theoretical knowledge one could need to insulate industrial piping, vessels, machinery, etc. Your author, *PlaneteDesertique*, learned the trade without trade school or formal training, and so I wish to make it easier for anyone else dedicated enough to learn the craft yet not paid enough to buy a more standard handbook.

However, this is merely a collection of information found elsewhere, and I cannot guarantee its accuracy, nor guarantee that it meets any standard.

## To Do:
- Add more content!
- Overhaul metal patterns:
   - Add lap, crimp, notch allowances
   - Replace images with svg files

## Contents

- [Insulation Materials](Insulation_Materials.md)
- [Metal Patterns](Metal_Patterns/Metal_Patterns.md)
- Reference Charts:
   - [Rigid Insulation Sizes](Rigid_Insulation_Size_Charts.md)
   - [Metal Sizes](Metal_Size_Charts.md)
