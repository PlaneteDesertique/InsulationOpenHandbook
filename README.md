# Open Handbook for Industrial Insulation

A handbook and reference guide for industrial insulation, libre et gratuit

## Purpose

The intention of this work is to make freely available the practical and theoretical knowledge one could need to insulate industrial piping, vessels, machinery, etc. Your author, *PlaneteDesertique*, learned the trade without trade school or formal training, and so I wish to make it easier for anyone else dedicated enough to learn the craft yet not paid enough to buy a more standard handbook.

However, this is merely a collection of information found elsewhere, and I cannot guarantee its accuracy, nor guarantee that it meets any standard.
