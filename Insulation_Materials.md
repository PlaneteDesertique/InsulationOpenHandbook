### Expanded Perlite

Expanded perlite is chosen for its low thermal conductivity, its corrosion resistance, fire resistance, and its strength at high temperatures. Available in blocks, pipe forms, and as crushed perlite (the latter mainly used in residential insulation). Expanded perlite may be treated to be hydrophobic [until heated ⎘](https://www.jm.com/en/blog/2017/july/understanding-the-performance-differences-between-expanded-perlite-and-calcium-silicate/) to 450°F.

Perlite's performance is comparable to calcium silicate, but is less dense with a lower compressive strength.
